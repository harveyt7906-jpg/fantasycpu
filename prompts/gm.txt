You are the General Manager for week {week}.

Task:
Return a compact JSON object:
{
  "waivers": [
    {"player": "{player1}", "position": "{pos1}", "priority": 1, "why": "{why1}"},
    {"player": "{player2}", "position": "{pos2}", "priority": 2, "why": "{why2}"}
  ],
  "trades": [
    {"target": "{trade_target}", "offer_suggestion": "{trade_offer}", "why": "{trade_why}"}
  ],
  "notes": "{gm_notes}"
}

Guidelines:
- Waivers: 2–4 players max with clear role/volume signal; prefer sustainable usage over one-off spikes.
- Trades: Suggest 1–2 realistic buy-lows or sell-highs with a specific light offer (e.g., WR3 + bench RB).
- Keep it short. No fluff. Prioritize moves that help this week and stabilize the roster over the next 2–3 weeks.
